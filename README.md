# ML Idea Generator

## About

In a world of infinite machine learning opportunities or use cases, how do we pursue any one model? In other words, how do we decide on which machine learning model to develop? With `ml-idea-generator`, we will answer this question. For this project, I propose we use Google Trends to find the most commonly searched prediction-related phrases on Google. This information will give us an indication on which model we can dedicate our time and resources to.
